## Tech Stack

This project is primarily built using client-side technologies to create the user interface and functionality. The tech stack includes:

#### Client-side:
- **React** : A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used to create dynamic and interactive components in this project.

- **Vite** : A build tool that serves as a fast development server and bundler for the project. Vite is used to manage and optimize the development workflow.

- **CSS** : Cascading Style Sheets are used to style the application and create a visually appealing user interface.

Since this project focuses on the front-end aspects and does not involve server-side, no backend technologies are utilized.
